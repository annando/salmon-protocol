= Introduction =

Please add more Salmon use cases that can be considered as part of the specification envelope and/or future extensions here.

= Details =

  * SelfSalmon
  * Unsolicited @replies and follows of people -- real time notifications and data updates for cross-site follower lists as well.
  * Published, signed "offers to sell" and "offers to buy" and "offers to hire".
  * License grant request for syndicated content (contact endpoint for structured "I want to re-use this content beyond fair use" requests)
  * Request for quotes (mortgage rates, auto insurance, ...) without revealing contact information.
  * Reputation generation via published activities -- an analysis of salmon.
  * Ratings via Salmon with provenance.
  * Non-hierarchical web of trust mechanism for public key verification -- if you are connected to A, A can send a signed salmon vouching for B's public key, obviating the need for a hierarchical certificate authority.
